Most of the programs here are for scientific programming. I am doing a module on Computational Physics within my Physics course so yeah that's where this comes from.

Also for me (linux running swift, this is essential)

export PATH=/home/parv/Downloads/swift-5.3-RELEASE-ubuntu20.04/usr/bin:"${PATH}"
swift pacakge init --type executable
swift run <package name>
nice
